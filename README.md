# Among us esolang interpreter made with python
 A simple interpreter built on Python for https://esolangs.org/wiki/Among_Us
 
 ***Still a WIP for the foreseeable future, but feel free to test it out if you come accross this by doing
 cd wherever/among-us-interpreter-py --> python main.py _filename.sus (Change contents of _filename.sus if you want to test more stuff)***
